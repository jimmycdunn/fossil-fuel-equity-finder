    "This tool can assess dollars invested in fossil fuel extraction companies and allocate carbon reserves via a fair share analysis. This tool only works with the data you give it, for example, if you give it individual equity posisions, the tool will only assess fossil fuel equity within your individual equity portfolio. If you give it carbon reserve data, like from Fossil Free Indexes' Carbon Undergound 200, then the tool will only allocate carbon reserves to their respective investments, not the operational emissions of the companies.\n"
