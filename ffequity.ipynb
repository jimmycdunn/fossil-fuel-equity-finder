    "# Fossil Fuel Equity Finder\n",
    "Note: Instructions on how to download and install Anaconda, scipy, and fuzzywuzzy will be included in the README.md file in the project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Jupyter notebook is to provide a centralized, front end document where the user of the tool can run the analysis, explore aggregate level data, and see various visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "This tool will provide you benchmark indicators on how many fossil fuel investments are embedded in your institution's investment portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Scope\n",
    "This tool can assess dollars invested in fossil fuel extraction companies and allocate carbon reserves via a fair share analysis. This tool only works with the data you give it, for example, if you give it individual equity posisions, the tool will only assess fossil fuel equity within your individual equity portfolio. If you give it carbon reserve data, like from Fossil Free Indexes' Carbon Undergound 200, then the tool will only allocate carbon reserves to their respective investments, not the operational emissions of the companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to have three data files for each year you want the tool to examine. You will need data on your individual equity positions, data on the fossil fuel extraction companies you want to look for and their carbon reserves, and data on the market capitalization values for the companies you want to look for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For equity data, consider requesting individual equity positions from your institutional investors. Most pension or retirement plans have overseeing boards or CIO offices managing the funds, and may be amenable to data requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For carbon data, consider requesting data from Fossil Free Index's Carbon Underground 200 which lists the top 100 coal and top 100 oil and natural gas publically traded international extraction companies and their listed reserves, converted to GtCO2.\n",
